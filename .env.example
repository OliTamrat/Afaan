# Anthropic API Configuration
# Get your API key from: https://console.anthropic.com/

# IMPORTANT: For the chat to work, you need to add your API key
# Option 1: Add it here as VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (for local development)
# Option 2: Add it in Vercel dashboard as environment variable (for production)

# Uncomment and add your key:
# VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-api-key-here

# OR use a backend proxy (recommended for production):
# VITE_API_PROXY_URL=https://your-backend.com/api/chat
